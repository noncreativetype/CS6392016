You will use fragments.
 
The image has to be an image placed in GitHub. It will be an image about your place of birth.
 
 
Part 3:
 
Push the code in YOUR GitHub account.
 
Put the apk (with the name LastnameFirstnameAsyncProjectMinSDKNumber.apk) at the root of AsyncTaskProject.
 
Create 1 screenshot of the app and push it also in the root of the directory.
 
 
Part 4:
 
Each app will be tested by another student who will install the app, test the app, and post feedback in the Discussion Board.
The title of the post in the Discussion Board will be the name of the student who is evaluated.
The app must be tested in portrait and landscape modes. It must also be tested on phones and tablets (even on emulators if you do not have Android phones/tablets).
It is your responsibility to coordinate with the other student. Feedback will be checked. Students who are not posting genuine feedback will get a 0 for the assignment.
Minimum and target SDKs must be provided.
 
Format of the feedback:

The code is available at: <URL of GitHub>.
The minimum SDK is <X>.
The target SDK is <X>.
The code, the apk and a screenshot are available at the right location in the GitHub repository. If not, please list the problems.
The code use / does not use fragments.
The app has been personalized by the student with an image of his/her place of birth.

Please mention all the problems with the app, what should be improved, and put a general comment. The best thing is to create screenshots to showcase the problems (with explanations).
